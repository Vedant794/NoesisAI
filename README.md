# Noesis AI

**Noesis AI** is a no-code tool designed to help developers quickly generate backend and frontend codebases based on simple prompts. With an easy-to-use interface, Noesis AI helps developers avoid wasting time on boilerplate code and focuses on accelerating the development process. Currently, Noesis AI generates Node.js backend code along with React frontend code, with more languages and features coming soon.

## Features

- **Industry-Specific Code Structure**: Noesis AI generates code following industry-standard practices and structures, making it easier to integrate with existing systems.
- **Node.js Backend**: Generate backend code using Node.js (with more languages coming soon).
- **React Frontend**: Generate a fully functional frontend in React.
- **Preview Section URL**: Get a preview URL to view the API and web application once generated.
- **5-Minute Running Instance**: After generating the code, a 5-minute running instance is provided to test the generated code and see it in action.
- **Open Source Integration**: Noesis AI leverages open-source APIs and plans to integrate more advanced LLMs (Large Language Models) for improved results.
- **No-Code Development**: Build working codebases without the need for coding, allowing developers to focus on more important tasks.

## How It Works

Noesis AI allows users to input simple prompts to generate backend and frontend code. Based on the prompt, Noesis AI uses an open-source API to generate the requested code and presents it in a preview section. The user can then run the instance for 5 minutes to test and check the generated code.

### Example Prompts

- *"Generate a simple Node.js backend API with a GET route for retrieving user data."*
- *"Generate a React frontend to display a list of products with a search feature."*
- *Generate a todo api."*

## Preview & Testing

- Once the code is generated, Noesis AI provides a preview URL for the API and web application.
- You can use this preview to quickly test and interact with the generated code.
